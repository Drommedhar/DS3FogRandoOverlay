# DS3 Fog Randomizer Overlay

This is a C# .NET 8 WPF application that provides an overlay for Dark Souls 3 Fog Gate randomizer.

## Project Structure
- **Models/**: Contains data models for fog gates, areas, and spoiler log data
- **Services/**: Contains core services for memory reading, spoiler log parsing, and area mapping
- **MainWindow**: The main overlay window that displays fog gate information

## Key Features
- Memory reading from Dark Souls 3 process to detect current player location
- Parsing of spoiler log files to get fog gate mappings
- Real-time overlay showing available fog gates in current area
- Support for both random and preexisting fog gates
- Boss fog gate highlighting

## Development Notes
- Uses Win32 API for process memory reading
- Memory offsets may need adjustment based on DS3 game version
- Area detection can be improved with better coordinate mapping
- The overlay is designed to be transparent and stay on top of the game

## Memory Reading
The application uses Windows API calls to read Dark Souls 3 process memory. The memory offsets used are approximations and may need to be updated based on:
- Game version
- Actual testing with Cheat Engine
- Community-provided memory addresses

## Spoiler Log Format
The application parses spoiler log files generated by the DS3 Fog Randomizer mod, which contain information about:
- Randomization seed and options
- Area connections and fog gate mappings
- Scaling percentages for areas
- Boss locations (marked with <----)
