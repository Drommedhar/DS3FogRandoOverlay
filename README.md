# DS3 Fog Randomizer Overlay

A C# .NET 8 WPF overlay application for Dark Souls 3 that displays fog gate information from the Fog Randomizer mod.

## Features

- **Real-time Overlay**: Displays over Dark Souls 3 showing current fog gate information
- **Memory Reading**: Reads DS3 process memory to detect current player location
- **Spoiler Log Integration**: Automatically parses the latest spoiler log from the Fog Randomizer
- **Smart Display**: Shows only relevant fog gates for the current area
- **Boss Highlighting**: Special highlighting for boss fog gates
- **Transparent Design**: Non-intrusive overlay that stays on top

## Requirements

- Dark Souls 3 (Steam version recommended)
- DS3 Fog Randomizer mod installed
- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- Windows operating system

## Installation

1. Download the latest release or build from source
2. Ensure Dark Souls 3 and the Fog Randomizer mod are installed
3. Run `DS3FogRandoOverlay.exe`

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd DS3FogRandoOverlay
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Usage

1. Start Dark Souls 3 with the Fog Randomizer mod
2. Launch the overlay application
3. The overlay will automatically:
   - Detect the running DS3 process
   - Load the latest spoiler log
   - Display fog gate information for your current area

## Controls

- **Hide/Show**: Toggle overlay visibility
- **Refresh**: Reload spoiler log data
- **Exit**: Close the application

## Configuration

The application automatically searches for the Fog Randomizer installation in common Steam directories:
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game\fog`
- `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game\fog`
- `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game\fog`
- `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game\fog`

## Technical Details

### Memory Reading
The application uses Windows API calls to read Dark Souls 3 process memory. Memory offsets are based on common patterns but may need adjustment for different game versions.

### Spoiler Log Parsing
Parses spoiler log files generated by the DS3 Fog Randomizer to extract:
- Fog gate connections between areas
- Boss locations
- Random vs. preexisting connections
- Area scaling information

### Area Detection
Currently uses a combination of:
- Map ID detection from memory
- Coordinate-based area mapping (basic implementation)

## Known Limitations

- Memory offsets may need updates for different DS3 versions
- Area detection could be improved with better coordinate mapping
- Requires the Cheat Engine table or similar for accurate memory addresses

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:
- Better memory offset detection
- Improved area mapping
- UI enhancements
- Additional features
